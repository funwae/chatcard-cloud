    <section id="about" class="cc-section cc-about">
      <div class="cc-section-inner">
        <h2>What is ChatCard?</h2>
        <p>
          ChatCard is a digital identity card for your AI presence. It doesn’t log you into sites—it tells AI systems who you are,
          how you like to interact, and what they’re allowed to do on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ChatCard can carry:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Your AI persona</strong> – language, tone, formality, accessibility preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Your model choices</strong> – preferred providers or models, where supported.</li>
          <li><strong>Your permissions</strong> – which actions AIs can take for you on a given site.</li>
          <li><strongYour privacy stance</strong> – how your data can be logged, stored, or used for training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When a site supports ChatCard, your AI doesn’t start from scratch. It meets you as <em>you</em>.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- FOR PEOPLE -->
    <section id="people" class="cc-section cc-people">
      <div class="cc-section-inner">
        <h2>For people who use AI everywhere</h2>
        <p>
          Today, every new AI app asks you to re-teach it who you are. ChatCard is a simple way to carry a consistent AI presence
          with you instead.
        </p>

          <article class="cc-card">
            <h3>One persona, many places</h3>
            <p>
              Set your preferred language, tone, and style once. Sites that support ChatCard can honor those preferences without
              you reconfiguring every time.

            <h3>Keep your AI on your side</h3>
            <p>
              A ChatCard tells AI what it’s <em>allowed</em> to do: read pages, fill forms, call actions, or just summarize. You
              decide the scope per site.

            <h3>Stay in control</h3>
            <p>
              You can see which sites you’ve connected, what permissions they have, and revoke them with a click. Your card is
              yours—not any one company’s lock-in.

              Over time, ChatCard can link to trails of your past AI-assisted work (stored where you choose), so new apps can
              help you pick up where you left off.

          ChatCard is designed to feel simple for users and straightforward for developers, while staying flexible enough to
          support different AI stacks.
        </p>

            <h3>1. You create your card</h3>
            <p>
              On chatcard.cloud (or within a compatible app), you set up your profile:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language(s) and preferred tone.</li>

              AI-enabled sites announce support for ChatCard via a standard header or meta tag. Your browser or companion app
              can then offer: “Use your ChatCard here?”

              <li>Your AI preferences relevant to that site.</li>

        <h2>Trust, safety, and control</h2>
        <p>
          ChatCard is about giving people more control over how AI acts on their behalf—not less. The standard is being designed
          with a few non-negotiable principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>You first.</strong> Your card exists to represent your preferences and limits, not to give unlimited power to
            apps or AIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent by design.</strong> Connections to new sites are explicit. Scopes are visible and revocable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Provider-neutral.</strong> ChatCard doesn’t lock you into any one AI vendor or platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear contracts.</strong> Sites declare what they want AIs to do; your card declares what you allow. Anything
            beyond that is out of bounds.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As the spec matures, we expect to work with partners on independent audits, open documentation, and interoperable
          implementations.

        <article class="cc-faq-item">
          <h3>Is ChatCard a product, a standard, or both?</h3>
          <p>
            ChatCard starts as an <strong>open standard</strong> for portable AI identity, with a reference implementation at
            chatcard.cloud. Other apps and platforms can implement compatible cards if they follow the spec.

        <article class="cc-faq-item">
          <h3>Does ChatCard replace my login?</h3>
          <p>
            No. ChatCard is about how AI recognizes and acts for you—not about account authentication. It can coexist with your
            existing login system.

        <article class="cc-faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need to pick one AI provider?</h3>
          <p>
            No. ChatCard is provider-neutral. It can express preferences, but it doesn’t lock you or developers into a specific
            vendor.
